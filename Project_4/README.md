### Question: Are the results what you expected? Speculate as to why it looks like CUDA isnâ€™t a great solution for this problem.  
I would think that GPU performance would outperform CPU perform, especially with large vector sizes. However, I believe the overhead required using CUDA is outweighing the peformance to be gained from using a GPU for this parallelization. Also, the task we are performing, incrementing values in an array, is relatively straightforward. I believe this is why the performance of the CPU is better than that of the GPU. If the task were more complicated, the GPU would likely outperform the CPU.
